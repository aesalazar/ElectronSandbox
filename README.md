# Electron Sanbox with Hot Reload
##### Orginally forked from: <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/electron/electron-quick-start">https://github.com/electron/electron-quick-start</a>
Provides a basic [Electron](https://github.com/electron/electron) app that includes hot reloading and jshint as depenencies.  At the time of this writing, the latest version of [Electron npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/electron) is 9.0.0.

With the included [electron-reload](https://www.npmjs.com/package/electron-reload), hot reloading is provided.  So, any edits to the source files while the app is running should automatically be reloaded when the save is detected.

Remember to first do a:

```
npm install
```

and then a:

```
npm start
```

to start.  Alternatively, this can be edited, lauched (F5), and debugged from within Visual Studio Code.  The `launch.json` file is already included.
